The goal of this workshop is to ...

The Vis Futures workshop will be part of IEEE VIS 2024 (October 13-18) and will be held in a hybrid format (St. Pete Beach, Florida, USA, and anywhere on earth on Zoom).
The workshop will take place on *DATE AND TIME TBD*.

> **Submissions — **
> Submit your Visualizations from the Future using this [Submission Form](https://forms.gle/mfE4q3c7HqAyJd8B6). You will be asked to provide for each Visualization from the Future you submit:
- A title
- A brief (<500 character) description
- A primary image
- [optional] up to 10 additional images
- [optional] a link to additional material such as a website or a youtube video

> Submissions should be your own work, but can include designs created for previous events, courses, or other design futuring venues.
**You can submit as many visualizations from the future as you wish** and we encourage you to submit early and often!

> ## Design Futuring Methods for Visualization
These submissions are in the form of a pictorial describing a (speculative) method for designing for the future. Such methods could be similar to existing design prompts like [The Thing From the Future](https://situationlab.org/tag/the-thing-from-the-future/) (a design futuring game not tailored to visualization) or the [Five Design Sheet methodology](http://fds.design/) (which is tailored to visualization but not a design futuring method).

> Design Futuring Methods for Visualization must be formatted using the Pictorials format based on the VISAP Pictorials format. [InDesign](./assets/templates/pictorials/VisFutures_pictorial_InDesign.zip) and [Word](./assets/templates/pictorials/VisFutures_pictorial_Word.zip) templates are available along with the necessary fonts and it is mandatory to use this format. Pictorials for Design Futuring Methods for Visualization should typically be 2-4 pages long (although we do not enforce any strict page limit), and making use of any of the template pages, or combinations thereof.
Pictorials heavily rely on visual description. See [VISAP Pictorials](https://visap.net/submission.html#pictorials) for inspiration.

> **Submissions — **
Submit your Design Futuring Method for Visualization using this [Submission Form](https://forms.gle/mfE4q3c7HqAyJd8B6). You will be asked to provide for each method you submit:
- A title
- A brief (<500 character) summary (i.e. the abstract for your submission)
- A PDF submission file following the Pictorials format as described above
- Information about how many people are needed to apply your Design Futuring Method for Visualization, what materials are needed, are there any type(s) of spaces needed and how long it takes to complete

# Timeline
...
>We accept submissions at any time. To encourage multiple submissions, provide feedback to authors rapidl, and continuously grow the gallery of visualizations from the futures on this website we will review submissions at three different times.
The three deadlines for submitting your work are:
- July 31
- August 15
- August 31
- September 30
- October 20
