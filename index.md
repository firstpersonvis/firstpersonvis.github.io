# First-Person Visualizations for Outdoor Physical Activities: Challenges and Opportunities - Workshop at [IEEE VIS 2024](https://ieeevis.org)

This half-day workshop will gather researchers and practitioners interested in first-person visualizations for outdoor physical activities.
Given the unexplored nature of the topic, the goal of this first workshop is to collect speculative designs informed by experience and expertise.

The goal of this workshop is to build on these speculative designs to i) explore the space of first-person visualizations for outdoor physical activities and ii) derive a research agenda for the visualization community.
We envision this output to take the form of a publication of which workshop participants will be invited to become co-authors.

The workshop will be part of [IEEE VIS 2024](https://ieeevis.org/) (October 13-18) and will be held in a hybrid format (St. Pete Beach, Florida, USA, and anywhere on earth on Zoom).

The workshop will take place on *DATE AND TIME TBD*.
